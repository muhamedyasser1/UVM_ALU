UVM Verification of ALU Design for 8051 IP Core
Overview
This project involves the verification of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) module for the 8051 microprocessor IP core using the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM). The ALU is crucial for executing arithmetic and logical operations within the microprocessor.

ALU Operations
The ALU supports various operations, including:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Decimal Adjust
Logical operations (NOT, AND, OR, XOR)
Bit rotations (left, right, with carry)
Increment
Exchange
No Operation (NOP)
Project Objectives
The primary objective is to verify the functionality and correctness of the ALU module using UVM. This includes developing a UVM testbench, running simulations, and analyzing results to ensure the ALU performs as specified.

UVM Components
Key UVM components used in the verification environment include:

Driver: Drives signals to the Design Under Test (DUT).
Monitor: Observes DUT outputs and converts them into transactions.
Sequencer: Controls the flow of sequences to the driver.
Agent: Encapsulates driver, monitor, and sequencer.
Environment: Contains agents and other components necessary for DUT verification.
Scoreboard: Checks correctness of DUT's output.
Subscriber: Listens to transactions for checking or coverage collection.
Verification Process
Understanding the ALU Design: Study the ALU module to understand its operations.
Setting Up the UVM Environment: Establish a UVM-based verification environment with all necessary components.
Writing Test Sequences: Develop test sequences to verify different ALU operations.
Running Simulations: Execute test sequences in a simulation environment.
Analyzing Results: Ensure the ALU performs as expected.
Generating Reports: Document the verification process, results, and coverage analysis.
Test Plan
The test plan includes defining test cases and scenarios, functional coverage, and assertions to validate the ALU's behavior thoroughly.

Test Cases and Scenarios
Test cases cover basic operations, special cases, and corner scenarios to ensure comprehensive verification.

Functional Coverage
Functional coverage tracks how thoroughly the ALU's functionality is exercised during verification.

Assertions
Assertions provide real-time checks to validate the DUT's behavior during simulation.

Simulation and Analysis
